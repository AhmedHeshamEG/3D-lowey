# Decisions

Every non-obvious choice, with the reason. Binding decisions from `docs/context.md` §10 are not repeated here
unless something changed.

## Engineering

**D1 — Three layers: LoweyCore (pure Swift) / LoweyRender (RealityKit) / App (SwiftUI).**
Core has zero Apple UI/3D imports, so its 100+ tests run on Linux in seconds (Docker on Windows, `swift:6.1` in CI).
RealityKit only exists in LoweyRender.

**D2 — Commands are an enum that returns its own inverse.**
`EditCommand.apply(to:)` returns `(inverse, changes)`. Undo = apply the inverse. This makes "every command reverts
perfectly" testable generically (`assertReverts` applies, inverts, re-applies and JSON round-trips each command)
and makes commands serialisable for Scene Scripts. Applying is atomic (works on a copy, commits on success).

**D3 — Gesture coalescing.** Continuous edits (joystick, gizmo drags, sliders) carry a `coalesceKey`; the session
merges them into one undo step and keeps the *first* inverse (pre-gesture state).

**D4 — Transform is stored as three animatable properties** (`position`, `rotation`, `scale`), not a separate field.
Phase 2 keyframes any property the same way; nothing about transforms is special.

**D5 — Colours quantised to 8 bits; dates stored as raw `timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate`.**
Hex colours and ISO dates lose precision, which broke "save → reopen → identical". Quantising on creation and storing
the native date value makes round trips bit-exact (tested).

**D6 — Versioned envelope + migration chain from day one.** Files are `{schemaVersion, kind, payload}`. Unversioned
files are treated as v0 and migrated (the v0 → v1 scene migration converts object arrays and nested transforms; tested
with a hand-written fake v0 file). Files from a newer app are refused with a clear message.

**D7 — Crash-safe writes.** `Data.write(.atomic)` plus a `.bak` of the previous good version; the loader falls back to
the backup when the main file is damaged (tested by corrupting a file). A damaged file never overwrites a good backup.

**D8 — Look lives on the project with an optional per-scene override.** `Scene.look == nil` inherits the project look.
The Enigma sets need three different moods in one project, but the palette should normally be shared.
"Only this scene" in the Look panel creates/removes the override.

**D9 — Primitives pivot at the centre of their base.** Things sit on the ground and grow upward when scaled (Lego-like),
which makes placing, stacking and swapping predictable.

**D10 — Smooth shading = auto-smooth (60°), not fully welded normals.** Hesham prefers soft low-poly; fully smoothed
cubes look like blobs. Auto-smooth keeps hard edges hard and round things soft. Flat = faceted.

**D11 — Drawn objects store the recipe (strokes + style), not triangles.** Small files, deterministic regeneration,
editable later (Phase 3 could re-style a stroke).

**D12 — Prefabs are referenced, not copied.** A prefab instance is one object (`kind: prefab(id)`); the renderer
expands the library fragment. Updating the prefab bumps its version and every instance rebuilds. "Unpack" turns an
instance back into editable objects. "Save a copy" keeps the selection as plain objects.

**D13 — Swap keeps position and rotation, fits the model uniformly into the blockout's size, keeps the base on the
ground.** Literally keeping the blockout's non-uniform scale would distort the model.

**D14 — Scatter is seeded.** The seed is part of the generated command, so undo/redo and re-applying a Scene Script
reproduce the same forest.

## Rendering

**D15 — ARView (non-AR) for the live stage, RealityRenderer for offscreen.**
`ARView(cameraMode: .nonAR)` is mature on iPadOS (not deprecated), gives direct UIKit gesture control, `ray(through:)`,
`project(_:)`, and statistics overlay. SceneKit is not used (soft-deprecated). `RealityView` was considered; ARView
won for picking/projection APIs and predictable camera control. Revisit in Phase 3 if RealityView gains something we need.

**D16 — Offscreen rendering spike: `RealityRenderer` (iPadOS 18+).**
Findings (verified against Apple's documentation):
- `RealityRenderer` is available on iPadOS 18+ (we target 26). It renders a separate set of entities
  (`entities`, `activeCamera`, `lighting` IBL, `cameraSettings.colorBackground/antialiasing`) into any `MTLTexture`
  via `updateAndRender(deltaTime:cameraOutput:…onComplete:)` with `CameraOutput(.singleProjection(colorTexture:))`.
- It needs its own entities, so we render a **clone** of the world (helpers stripped). Clones share meshes and
  materials, so this is cheap.
- `deltaTime` is ours to choose → Phase 2 video export renders frame by frame at a fixed timestep, independent of
  real-time speed. Output textures are `bgra8Unorm_srgb`, shared storage, read back with `getBytes`.
- Proven in CI by `RenderTests.testEnigmaSetsRenderOffscreen` (renders every Enigma set at 16:9 and 9:16 and checks the
  image isn't blank) and by library thumbnails. Fallbacks considered: `ARView.snapshot` (only what's on screen, fixed
  size) and raw Metal (too much to rebuild). Not needed.

**D17 — Fog is in the material, not a post-process.** RealityKit has no fog. ARView's post-process callback has depth
but `RealityRenderer` exposes no depth output, so a post-process fog would differ between preview and export.
A `CustomMaterial` surface shader computes exponential distance fog per pixel from the view-space position — identical
everywhere. Imported materials are converted with `CustomMaterial(from:surfaceShader:)` (textures kept). If the shader
library can't load, everything falls back to `PhysicallyBasedMaterial` without fog (logged; tested in CI).

**D18 — The shader lives in the LoweyRender package** and is compiled by Xcode into the package bundle
(`makeDefaultLibrary(bundle: .module)`), so the render tests exercise it too; the loader also checks the app bundle.

**D19 — Orthographic = 2° telephoto.** `OrthographicCameraComponent` exists (iOS 18) but ARView/RealityRenderer camera
support for it is less proven, and picking/projection would need a second code path. A 2° field of view from far away
is visually orthographic, works in both renderers, and keeps one ray/projection path. The sky dome follows the camera
and grows so it never clips.

**D20 — Sky = unlit dome with a generated gradient + stars texture; ambient light = IBL generated from the same sky.**
Night scenes get dark, cool ambient light automatically; day scenes get bright ambient — one decision (the mood)
drives both.

**D21 — Instancing: shared resources, not `MeshInstancesComponent` (yet).** Model clones share their prototype's
`MeshResource` and materials; identical Lowey surfaces share one material instance. RealityKit batches these.
`RenderTests.testFiftyInstancesPlaceAndRender` asserts the 50 foxes share one mesh. `MeshInstancesComponent` (iOS 26)
is the Phase 3 performance-pass option for thousands of static objects (it loses per-instance selection).

**D22 — Selection and picking use box collision shapes** from content bounds (cheap). Drawing on an object uses an
exact CPU raycast against the object's world mesh (`MeshRaycast`, tested), built on demand when a stroke starts.

**D23 — Snapshots match the on-screen framing guide.** The export camera's field of view is derived from the guide
rectangle drawn over the stage, so a 9:16 snapshot contains exactly what the portrait guide showed.

## Library & assets

**D24 — glTF/GLB are kept as files in the library and loaded with GLTFKit2 each session.** Converting to USDZ on device
isn't possible without Mac tools. `.gltf` imports copy their referenced `.bin`/textures (tested).

**D25 — Rig detection by joint-name heuristics** (Mixamo, Quaternius-style, generic; birds via wing/beak, quadrupeds via
front/back legs or tail without arms). Skeletons and clips are kept intact for Phase 2; the library shows a RIGGED badge.

**D26 — Search-first library with ranking** (exact name > prefix > word prefix > tag > substring > fuzzy subsequence,
every word must match, favourites get a boost). Filters: All, Favorites, Recent, Models, Built (prefabs), Looks.

## Product

**D27 — New project = a name + one mood.** Few decisions, big result; everything else can change later.

**D28 — First launch creates the "Enigma — sets" sample** (desk + paper + warm lamp; 12 people at PCs; hero robot in a
cave), built only from blockout, drawing recipes and lights through the command system. It's both onboarding and the
Phase 1 proof.

**D29 — Pencil draws, fingers navigate** (Draw tool). A toggle allows finger drawing for people without a Pencil.

**D30 — Tapping part of a group selects the top-most group; tapping again digs one level deeper** (Keynote/Figma
style), so blocked-out assemblies behave like Lego pieces.

## CI

**D31 — Runner `xcode-27` with Xcode 27.0 pinned (`DEVELOPER_DIR`).** It's the image with the iPadOS 27 SDK.
Deployment target stays iPadOS 26.0 (SpeechAnalyzer needs 26).

**D32 — Render tests run as an unhosted test bundle** linking the packages directly, so RealityKit code is tested on
the simulator without linking the packages twice into a hosted bundle. The UI smoke test drives the real app.

**D33 — Test screenshots and renders are exported from the xcresult as a CI artifact** (`test-attachments`) — visual
evidence without a Mac.
